                <p>As the product Engineer is diff from full stack, what all different preparation must we do when we
                    join as a fresher, as we'd not be very fimilar with the projects at first. But as full stack we know
                    what our work revolves around.</p>

                <p>Is SRE(Site Reliability Engineering) a different vertical of Publicis.Sapient or is it a methodology
                    which is to be followed?</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Shouldn't prioritization of the problems faced in the universe air project needs to be done based on
                    frequency and duration of the travel of the passenger?</p>

                <hr>
                <p>As per the lean development, the product must be released frequently and then evolve iteratively
                    based on customer feedback. But doesn't this strategy can be taken as an advantage by the competitor
                    in grabbing the idea and delivering the product early than ours?</p>

                <p>What is the optimum time that needs to be allocated for all the three phases separately in the design
                    thinking process? Does the project influence this time period allotment?</p>

                <hr>
                <p>What if there are 2 problems for which there can't be a single composite solution to work upon? Shall
                    we have to choose any one of them or teams must be set different to work upon those separately?</p>
